Rakenne is a database modeling tool for command line written in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/).

For now, It is a toy project to improve author's skills with the language and its various libraries. **It is very early stage and is not supposed to work (yet). Please don't use it in production.** :warning:

Note: _rakenne_ means _structure, construction_ in Finnish.

## Roadmap

* :arrow_right: **define a DSL for modeling database**
  * :arrow_right: [describe entity-relationship diagrams (ERD)](doc/erd-dsl.md) using MERISE notation
  * :arrow_right: [describe logical model diagrams (LMD)](doc/lmd-dsl.md)
* :x: create a command-line tool 
  * :x: describe needed operations and parameters
  * :x: write the code to handle all those operations
* :x: render models into diagrams with [GraphViz](https://www.graphviz.org/)
  * :x: ERD to MERISE MCD diagrams
  * :x: ERD to Chen notation diagrams
  * :x: LMD to MERISE MLD diagrams
* :x: validate model
* :x: convert across different database reprentations
  * :x: convert ERD to LMD
  * :x: convert LMD to database specific SQL
  * :x: reverse-engineer database-specific SQL to LMD
  * :x: reverse-engineer LMD to ERD
* :x: support multiple physical models
  * :x: sql
  * :x: nosql (:warning: that requires de-normalizing)
* :x: support multiple SQL and NoSQL languages
  * :x: SQL: postgresql
  * :x: SQL: mariadb
  * :x: NoSQL: redis
  * :x: NoSQL: mongodb
  * :x: NoSQL: cassandra CQL (:warning: that requires knowing which requests will be made)
